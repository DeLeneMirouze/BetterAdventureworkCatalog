# BetterAdventureworkCatalog

This repository is a Proof of Concept for Azure Search
It is inspired from this project:
https://azuresearchadventureworksdemo.codeplex.com/

But I solved all the coding issues and try to develop a better quality code.

This Poc demonstrates:

## Injector


* Creating an index
* deleting an index
* updating an existing index
* populating an index with docs
* updating a doc

## Web Site

* Reddog.Search
* Suggest
* Search
* Lookup
* stemming
* All/any mode
* Facetting
* Smart guided navigation
* scoring
